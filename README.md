# Youtube Video Picker

_TODO:_ This README won't really help anybody as of now.

## Build app and server

```shell
make build
```

The server can be found as `server/dist/ytvp-server` and is just a binary.
See [README](server/README.md) for more details.

The app is just a bunch of html and js in `app/dist/` and can be deployed on any webserver.
See [README](app/README.md) for more details.
